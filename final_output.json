    "Summary": "Ms. Jones suffered a whiplash injury in a car accident last September. She had to go through ten sessions of physiotherapy to help with the stiffness and discomfort. Given your progress, I\u2019d expect you to make a full recovery within six months of the accident. There are no signs of long-term damage or degeneration, so I don\u2019t need to worry about this affecting me in the future. If anything changes or you experience worsening symptoms, you can always come back for a follow-up.",
